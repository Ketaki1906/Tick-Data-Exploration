# Future Improvements to Prevent Race Conditions

### **1. Enforce Event Ordering**

* We can use partitioning by `event_id` systems like done in Kafka to ensure all related messages belonging to an event go to the same partition and are processed in order. 
* This will help the partition to be consumed by only one worker and thus maintain strict sequential processing of that event_id, preventing overlapping process windows or race conditions.

### **2. Idempotent Processing Logic**

* We can design consumers in such a way that processing the same event multiple times will lead to the same result without any side effects or errors.
* We can also store a processing state (`processed_at`, `status`, `checksum`) in cache so that it helps in avoiding effects of duplicate or retried events.

### **3. Distributed Locks or Leases**

* We can use distributed locks (e.g., with Redis, Zookeeper) to ensure only one worker can process a specific `event_id` at a time.
* Lease expiration can help to prevent deadlocks or worker failures from halting processing.

### **4. Centralized Event Coordinator**

* We can introduce a central hub that coordinates event distribution and assigns processing rights.
* Although, resource-heavy and costly, this can hold state like event locks, timeouts, worker load, etc and thus prevent any race conditions most efficiently.

### **5. Reliability score for Workers**

* We can implement a worker fairness system where each worker has a reliability score.
* If a worker causes overlapping events or repeated retries, its score decreases.
* Workers with high scores get prioritized for future assignments.
* This allows an active filtering and prioritizing of error-prone or out-of-sync workers.

### **6. Imrpovements to De-Duplication**

* The de-duplication algorithm can be greatly improved if input from multiple sources is allowed (`03_worker_logs.csv` + `04_final_output.csv` for example).
